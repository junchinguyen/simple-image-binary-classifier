# **Customizable Binary Image Classifier** üñºÔ∏è

A fully customizable binary image classifier built from scratch, without using machine learning frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow. This classifier categorizes images into two classes: `1` for matching the target class, and `0` for non-matching images.

## **Motivation** üéØ
My primary goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations of deep learning by implementing a neural network from the ground up, without relying on pre-built ML frameworks.

## **Key Features** ‚öôÔ∏è
- **Customizable Network Architecture**: Define the number of layers and the size of each layer to create a network suited to the problem at hand.
- **No Framework Dependency**: Self-implemented, allowing for full control and visibility into the neural network's functioning.
- **Image Classification**: Trained on binary classification tasks, making predictions on whether an input image matches a specific class.

## **How It Works** üß†
1. **Input & Preprocessing**: Converts and standardizes input images.
2. **Network Configuration**: Users can specify architecture details, including layer sizes and number of layers.
3. **Training**: Uses backpropagation and gradient descent to optimize model performance.
4. **Prediction**: Outputs binary predictions (`1` or `0`) based on the learned parameters.
